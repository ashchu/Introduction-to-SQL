# Introduction to SQL

The *Introduction to SQL* course is a goes over the basics, and covers querying a database, sorting results, and using joins and unions. It covers how to use aggregate data, and filter. We also look at how to create a table, and drop it.

First, review the [slides for the *Introduction to SQL course*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-FhnRYrehe3VSlITi6geGqh-DrtSP6nPN4tiPgpbGqQ/present). After you are comfortable with the material, go through the [exercises](Exercises.md). We have provided a database with data that you can interact with for the exercises.
