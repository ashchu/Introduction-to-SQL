# SQL Overview
I never remember SQL, so hopefully this document will serve as a quick 101 crash course.

**SQL** is a declarative programming language used to retrieve information from databases. As a declarative language, SQL focuses solely on the result. 

Each value stored in a database is a *record*. Using queries, we can access records in their tables. SQL is one of the nest known query languages.

- All SQL statements end with a `;`
